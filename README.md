# dm_twimong - Having fun with the twitter API

Welcome people to joining my idea of data mining the twitter data given by their API.
This project was initiated by having own interest in this subject, aswell as creating a project for a seminar at university.

=============
### The goal of this project is:

- [x] Collecting data from twitter streams
- [ ] Store the data in different data bases (NoSQL and RDBMS)
-- [ ] MongoDB
-- [ ] MariaDB
-- [ ] MySQL
- [ ] Analyze the data for different scenarios (language, hashtags etc.)
- [ ] Visualize the data stored (location) - HeatMap
- [ ] Perform analysis wether a MongoDB, MySQL or MariaDB is the best choice to store the data
 
=============
### The project is seperated in different packages:

> **anaylze**: This package includes all the queries for analyzing the data stored in databases,

> **connection**: This package includes all the classes for creating connections to databases and the twitter stream.
