# dm_twimong - Having fun with the twitter API

Welcome people to joining my idea of data mining the twitter data given by their API. <br />
This project was initiated by having own interest in this subject, aswell as creating a project for a seminar at university.

=============
### The goal of this project is:

- [x] Collecting data from twitter streams
- [x] Store the data in a MongoDB (NoSQL and RDBMS) 
- [x] Analyze the data for different scenarios (language, hashtags etc.)
- [x] Visualize the data stored /javascript
- [ ] make it pretty!
 
=============
### The project is seperated in different packages:

> **anaylze**: This package includes all the queries for analyzing the data stored in databases,

> **connection**: This package includes all the classes for creating connections to databases and the twitter stream.

> **visualization**: This package includes all the classes for visualizing the data stored (Javascript based including D3.js, AngularJs and Websocket)
